                        <p><b>Solving edge cases related to existing users</b><br>
                        Existing users had a hard time understanding the benefit of upgrading to direct bank feeds when the process was so laborious. Existing users already had data coming from screen-scraping. Migrating to a new connection method caused data issues that we had to guide users through resolving.</p>
                        <p><b>Reconciling integration and experience across different product tech stacks</b><br>
                        Notification systems in QBO and QBSE are technologically different, making it difficult to coordinate messaging to users. Also, this direct bank feed feature integration had to fit in with both QBO and QBSE despite differences in their flows.</p>
                        <p><b>Aligning with other connection methods</b><br>
                        Various AU and UK banks also use a connection method called WebAuth. We worked to consolidate and extend design patterns and technology to the WebAuth use case as well.</p>
                        <p><b>Solving bank specific use cases</b><br>
                        Some banks had specific requests which we had to design and solve for. I worked closely with engineering to understand and ensure my design solutions for one bank could scale to another.</p>

                        <p>Given the constraints of what we could do in V1, there's ample opportunity to improve the experience.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How can we minimize manual work? What are the technical limitations of getting data and automating the process?</li>
                            <li>How can we position user tasks around their comprehension and mental models of bank connections?</li>
