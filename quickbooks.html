                        <p><b>Solving edge cases related to existing users</b><br>
                        Existing users had a hard time understanding the benefit of upgrading to direct bank feeds when the process was so laborious. Existing users already had data coming from screen-scraping. Migrating to a new connection method caused data issues that we had to guide users through resolving.</p>
                        <p><b>Reconciling integration and experience across different product tech stacks</b><br>
                        Notification systems in QBO and QBSE are technologically different, making it difficult to coordinate messaging to users. Also, this direct bank feed feature integration had to fit in with both QBO and QBSE despite differences in their flows.</p>
                        <p><b>Aligning with other connection methods</b><br>
                        Various AU and UK banks also use a connection method called WebAuth. We worked to consolidate and extend design patterns and technology to the WebAuth use case as well.</p>
                        <p><b>Solving bank specific use cases</b><br>
                        Some banks had specific requests which we had to design and solve for. I worked closely with engineering to understand and ensure my design solutions for one bank could scale to another.</p>
                        <p><b>Changes in product management</b><br>
                        High turnover of product managers due to re-orgs in QBO caused significant churn. I spent much time educating partners on the project and influencing changing priorities.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased QuickBooks’ direct bank feed market coverage in UK by 30% and in AU to 76%, surpassing competitors' coverage</li>
                            <li>Significant reduction in care calls received regarding screen-scraping connection issues as users migrate to direct bank feeds</li>

                        <p>Given the constraints of what we could do in V1, there was ample opportunity to improve the experience. I collaborated with our platform team to explore enhancements for future versions using user feedback from V1.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manual entry of form information is a big deterrent, especially when some banks require many fields. Can we automate getting this data? What are the engineering limitations?</li>
                            <li>Users can't distinguish the difference between the two connection types. Knowing this, is there a better way to position the tasks?</li>
                            <li>Printing, hand-signing, and mailing the form is a big pain point. How can we work with banks to update this process while complying with regulations?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Currently, our team is working through all these enhancements. We're coordinating with product teams and financial institutions to break down the steps to reach an ideal state geared towards minimal work for the user. I’m currently designing and prototyping the optimal experience for each intermediate release.</p>
